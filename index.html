        <h2>Intro Paragraph</h2>
        <h3>Thesis:</h3>
        <p>The biggest lie told in society today is the life you want is a life of comfort. Comfort is believed to offer happiness, but does the opposite. </p>
        <h4>1st main paragraph</h4>
        <h5>The most remembered challenge given was the challenge of being the only senior at the retreat and being in charge of 8th graders and underclassmen who didn't see eye to eye.</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>High school students were frustrating and were more out of line than the 8th graders</li>
            <li>Difficult to solve and embrace different challenges posed by the underclassmen</li>
            <li>felt backwards because I was supposed to be in charge of the younger students and yet I dealt with highschoolers the most.</li>
            <li>even though I was frustrated I knew that the lack of comfort I felt was leading me to better things even though small.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>second paragraph</h4>
        <h5>The other challenge I had to deal with was during the weeks of preparation. I wasn't chosen to give a talk for the retreat, but because of the amount of students who stopped serving on the retreat, I was given a talk 3 days before.</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>The topic I was given was: How can you be yourself?</li>
            <li>I explained that I have had a hard time being myself in the past.</li>
            <li>Freshman year and Junior year I started changing and I became more friendly and open to others. I started having much more meaningful relationships.</li>
            <li>I explained this transition through colors.</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>8th grade I was deep purple</li>
            <li>I became orange over time and was more inviting</li>
            <li>Senior year I became a yellow.</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>the transition throughout highschool was not quick, but it was needed and I am much better and happier than I used to be.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <h5> These experiences were stressful, but even after months of completing the retreat, I remembered that comfort is meaningless and we need to struggle.  </h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Comfort is meaningless and will not lead to happiness, but rather being challenged has help me realize how important it is to be in places without comfort.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>finished paper</h2>
        <p>The biggest lie told in society today is the life you want is a life of comfort. However, saying yes to comfort is equivalent to saying yes to fear, worldly desires, and basic pleasure. Comfort is believed to offer happiness, but does the opposite. The quote “The world offers you comfort, but you were not made for comfort, you were made for greatness” said by JP2 has been useful in revealing what it means to do service at Holy Trinity and leading their Timothy 4 Retreat earlier this year. I have worked retreats like these in the past and last year, I did Luke 18 as my CSP. Even though these are very similar types of service, I was definitely challenged more this year. I was challenged in patience with underclassmen along with 8th graders and in last minute witness writing. </p>
        <p>The most remembered challenge given was the challenge of being the only senior in my sleep home and not having to be in charge of just three 8th graders, but also being in charge of a junior and sophomore who did not exactly see eye to eye. These younger high school students were frustrating when at our sleep homes and I remember they were more inappropriate and immature than the 8th graders. It was difficult for me to put aside how tired I was and focus on these 5 student challenges. The junior felt sick, the sophomore felt frustrated and had various dramatic events going on during the day, the easiest people to deal with were the 8th graders. This felt backwards to me. I was supposed to be babysitting the younger students not the high school kids. At the time, this frustration hindered me from having a great time on this retreat. I felt like I was given an injustice in having to babysit eight people instead of just 3, but now using JP2’s quote, I realize that this may have been for the better. The lack of comfort I felt was leading towards the road of selflessness I need to be on. I rarely complained out loud to anyone the way I was feeling so I hope the way I took up these burdens was graceful instead of dramatic.</p>
        <p>The other challenge I had to deal with was during the weeks of preparation, I was not chosen to give a witness, but because of the amount of students who dropped this service opportunity, I was given a topic about 3 days before the retreat. The topic I was given was something along the lines of “How can you be yourself?” I explained to the kids that I have had a hard time being myself especially during 8th grade, freshman, and sophomore year. However, junior year, I started changing. I became more friendly and open to others; I started having more meaningful relationships with others and with Jesus, especially through mother Mary. But the way I explained this transition was through colors. I said that in 8th grade I was like a deep purple, I wasn’t very welcoming, but I was still a little pretty. Then during junior year I started becoming a bright orange. People have told me that if I was a color I would be the color orange and at first I hated this comparison, but not it kind of resonates with me. This lack of preparation was very difficult for me, these kinds of things make me uncomfortable and nervous, but this witness was actually the best witness I had given at any Luke 18 or Timothy 4 Retreat. This challenge was actually very fruitful for me, I learned a lot about myself and it helped me realize who I really was as a person. The lack of comfort I had in this experience was incredibly fruitful and important to me.</p>
        <p>These experiences were stressful and overbearing, but even months after completing this service, the words of JP2 were able to connect and resonate with me. It was true for me that the life of comfort is meaningless and will not lead to happiness, but rather being challenged has help me realize how important it is to be in places without comfort. </p>
