        <h1>Comfort Kills</h1>
        <h2>Intro Paragraph</h2>
        <h3>Thesis:</h3>
        <p>The biggest lie told in society today is the life you want is a life of comfort. Comfort is believed to offer happiness, but does the opposite. </p>
        <h4>1st main paragraph</h4>
        <h5>The most remembered challenge given was the challenge of being the only senior at the retreat and being in charge of 8th graders and underclassmen who didn't see eye to eye.</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>High school students were frustrating and were more out of line than the 8th graders</li>
            <li>Difficult to solve and embrace different challenges posed by the underclassmen</li>
            <li>felt backwards because I was supposed to be in charge of the younger students and yet I dealt with highschoolers the most.</li>
            <li>even though I was frustrated I knew that the lack of comfort I felt was leading me to better things even though small.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>second paragraph</h4>
        <h5>The other challenge I had to deal with was during the weeks of preparation. I wasn't chosen to give a talk for the retreat, but because of the amount of students who stopped serving on the retreat, I was given a talk 3 days before.</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>The topic I was given was: How can you be yourself?</li>
            <li>I explained that I have had a hard time being myself in the past.</li>
            <li>Freshman year and Junior year I started changing and I became more friendly and open to others. I started having much more meaningful relationships.</li>
            <li>I explained this transition through colors.</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>8th grade I was deep purple</li>
            <li>I became orange over time and was more inviting</li>
            <li>Senior year I became a yellow.</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>the transition throughout highschool was not quick, but it was needed and I am much better and happier than I used to be.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <h5> These experiences were stressful, but even after months of completing the retreat, I remembered that comfort is meaningless and we need to struggle.  </h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Comfort is meaningless and will not lead to happiness, but rather being challenged has help me realize how important it is to be in places without comfort.</li>
        </ul>
